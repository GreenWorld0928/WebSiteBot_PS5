# WebSiteBot_PS5
This is a bot that will buy a PS5 through Walmart. It's written in python and uses selenium to interact with web pages. It's a very simple program that uses recursion to prevent the code from crashing from running faster than the webpage. There's no promise it'll work everytime though. If the site crashes, the code will stop. There's currently only a bot for Walmart's PS5 disc edition. 


## Installments
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)

## Before Running
Before running the code, you have to change the values for your personal information. Make sure you change the varables with the spelling format myVariable. They should be pretty intuitive.
